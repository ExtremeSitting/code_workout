Resources:
    apt packages:

Process:
Checkout your 'answers' branch (git checkout answers)
Change to the '2' directory.
Review the dictionary-sample.py script. This script reads a file of newline delimited words and counts the number of words that start with the prefix given.
Run the script with out arguments, then with '--help', then read the script.

Goals:
    1) Parse the dictionary file (american-english) and only print words that are greater than 4 characters
    2) Parse the dictionary file and print the length and number of words of that length in csv
        ex: <num of chars in word>,<num of words of that length>
            3,300
    3) Write a script that accepts one argument (a file name) to count the number of lines in the file

For the bold:
    re-write the dictionary-sample.py script in bash.


Make sure to use your 'answers' branch locally for all your work.
